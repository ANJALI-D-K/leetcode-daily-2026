1390. Four Divisors
Hint
Given an integer array nums, return the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors. 
If there is no such integer in the array, return 0

Intuition
Looking at this problem, I need to find numbers with exactly 4 divisors and sum those divisors. Instead of checking all numbers up to n as divisors, I can optimize by only checking up to sqrt(n). For each divisor found, I also get its complement (n/divisor), effectively finding pairs of divisors. I need to be careful with perfect squares where divisor equals its complement.

Approach
I'm using optimized divisor counting with sqrt optimization:

Initialize total sum to 0
For each number in nums:
Initialize divisor count and internal sum for this number
Loop through potential divisors from 1 to sqrt(i):
Check if divisor divides i evenly
If yes, calculate the complementary divisor (other = i // divisor)
If divisor equals other (perfect square case):
Count as 1 divisor, add once to sum
Otherwise:
Count as 2 divisors (the pair), add both to sum
If count exceeds 4, break early (optimization)
If exactly 4 divisors found, add internal sum to total
Return the accumulated total
The sqrt optimization reduces the divisor checking from O(n) to O(sqrt(n)) per number.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n⋅ 
m
​
 )
where n is the length of nums and m is the maximum value in nums. For each number, we check divisors up to its square root.

Space complexity: O(1)
We only use a few variables for counting and accumulating sums, regardless of input size.

Code
class Solution {
    public int sumFourDivisors(int[] nums) {
        int divSum = 0;

        for (int n : nums) {
            int divCount = 0, inSum = 0;

            for (int d = 1; d * d <= n; d++) {
                if (n % d == 0) {
                    int other = n / d;

                    if (d == other) {
                        divCount++;
                        inSum += d;
                    } else {
                        divCount += 2;
                        inSum += d + other;
                    }

                    if (divCount > 4)
                        break;
                }
            }

            if (divCount == 4)
                divSum += inSum;
        }

        return divSum;
    }
}
