1975. Maximum Matrix Sum
You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:

Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.
Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.

Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above
Greedy algorithm.
Since every operation makes the adjacent pair changing signs, it can make all values non-negative up to 1 exception, if there are odd number of negative numbers in total.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(N∗M)

Space complexity:
O(1)

Code
class Solution {
    public long maxMatrixSum(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;

        int leastElement = 100001;
        long sum = 0L;
        int negativeCount = 0;

        for(int[] rows : matrix ){
            for(int value : rows){
                if(value < 0){
                    negativeCount++;
                    value = -value;
                }

                sum += value;
                if(value < leastElement){
                    leastElement = value;
                }
                
            }
        }

        return (negativeCount%2 == 0) ? sum : (sum - 2*leastElement);
    }
}
